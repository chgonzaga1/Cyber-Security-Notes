IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is an email protocol that for accessing and managing email directly on the mail server, 
rather than downloading and removing it like POP3.  

The emails is stored onthe server and all of our devices can read the same email state as it was. 
We can read, delete move or flag it and it will synchronized everywhere.
Menaing what happens to email, will happen to your phone, desktop or other devices such as laptop. 

Hence, it's one of the reasons why IMAP is better than POP 3. 
The email history are preserved and it's easy for security technicians to audit and troubleshoot. 

Unlike POP3, we dont have to download everything when we organzing the mail. 

IMAP is used by GMAIL, outlook, yahoo, mobile device, cloud storage and large inboxes.  
IMAP also happens ot have sophisticated commands than pop3. 

It's default ports are TCP 143 and IMAPS TCP 933. 

Here are 
LOGIN <username> <password> authenticates the user
SELECT <mailbox> selects the mailbox folder to work with
FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name> Example fetch 3 body[] to fetch message number 3, header and body.
MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox> moves the specified messages to another mailbox
COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name> copies the specified messages to another mailbox
STORE <sequence_set> <flags> adds or removes flags that are read /unread
LOGOUT logs out
CAPABILITY shows what features the iMAP server supports
EXMAINE <MAILbox> Opens a mailbox in read-only mode.
NOOP keeps the connection alive without doign anything

Knowing that the IMAP server listens on TCP port 143 by default, we will use telnet to connect to 10.67.180.89’s port 143 and fetch the message we sent in an earlier task.
