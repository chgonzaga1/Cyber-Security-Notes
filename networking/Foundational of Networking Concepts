Unicast means sending data from one device directly to one specific device on a network.
It’s a one-to-one communication: one sender, one receiver.

Example:
Your computer sending a message only to your friend’s computer.

Multicast means sending data from one device to a selected group of devices on the network.
It’s a one-to-many communication  but only to devices that are part of that specific group, not to everyone, 

Broadcoast means to ALL Recievers 

A broadcast domain is a “zone” in a network where broadcast messages can reach all devices. A router is a device that seperates domains. 


A collision domain is a section of a network where data packets can “collide” with each other because they share the same communication path.

On a hub, everything is shared.
Any packet sent in one port is sent out of every port.
Because of this, the entire hub is one big collision domain.

On a switch, it’s different.
Switches send data only to the device it’s meant for.
This means each switch port is its own collision domain, which prevents collisions.

A subnet mask is a number that that indicates a device which part of an IP address, is the **network** and which part is the **host.**
You need a subnet mask because without it, devices can’t find the network and can’t communicate, properly. Subnet masks are 4 bytes.

Every IP address class has a default subnet mask
Class A → 255.0.0.0 (/8)
Class B → 255.255.0.0 (/16)
Class C → 255.255.255.0 (/24)

The (/8), (/16), (/24) indicates how many 11111111s are there in a 4 byte, and it's the 11111111 that masking the net

ex) 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000000 = 255.0.0.0

Here's an example how subnet masks are being used:
A debvce has an IP Address of  192.168.1.20 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24)
A router might ask, What part is the network? using the subnet mask, 

The 255s tell you that 191.168.1 are the network part, hence 255.255.255.x
while x.x.x.20 is the host part
