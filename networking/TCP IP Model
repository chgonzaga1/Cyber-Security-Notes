The TCP/IP Model is the practical and current, real-world networking model used by the entire internet.
While the OSI Model is more of a conceptual framework, the TCP/IP model is the actual model computers and routers follow when sending data today.

TCP/IP stands for:
TCP — Transmission Control Protocol
IP — Internet Protocol

These are the two core protocols that form the basis of internet communication.
Developed by The U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s to make large networks more reliable, 
decentralized and manageable/control, and able to keep working even if parts of the network failed.
