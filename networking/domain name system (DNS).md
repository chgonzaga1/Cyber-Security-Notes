What is a Domain Name system?

DNS is basically the system that translates domain names into IP addresses. It mostly uses UDP port 53 because it’s fast, but it switches to TCP 53 when the data is large or for zone transfers. 
  
   DNS has different record types: A and AAAA for IP mapping, CNAME for aliases, MX for email, TXT for extra info.
For security work, DNS is super important because attackers constantly abuse it. 
They do DNS tunneling to sneak data out, fast-flux to rotate IPs, cache poisoning, and hijacking.  
Malware often uses DNS to find command-and-control servers or uses DGAs to generate tons of random domains.  
As a SOC analyst, you monitor DNS logs for strange patterns. 

  An A record connects a domain name to an IPv4 address. Basically, it tells the internet “this website lives at this exact IP.”
