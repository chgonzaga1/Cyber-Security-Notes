ICMP means Internet Control Message Protocol.

Note thatICMP is not a program, not an application, not a service, and not a port-based protocol like TCP or UDP.
What ICMP actually is, it's a messaging protocol built into the IP layer (Layer 3).

Its job is to let devices send control messages to each other about what’s happening on the network.
Think of ICMP as the network’s feedback system.
