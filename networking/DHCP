DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

is a network service that automatically assigns IP configuration to devices so they can join a network automatically

When your smart phone, laptop, or smart TV connects to Wi-Fi, they require a 
1.IP address
2.Subnet mask
3.Default gateway
4.DNS servers

They also needlease time, domain name, WINS servers, etc.

Instead of typing all this manually into the network configuration, the DHCP server gives it to you automatically when connected to the WiFi.

DHCP runs at the Application-layer protocol, layer 7 of the OSI model. It's a service protocol and it uses User Datagram Protocol
UDP is lightweight and it has no connection handshake, meaning it looks for speed.
DHCP is usually setup already before it connects wifi
DHCP server listens on UDP port 67 and DHCP client uses  UDP port 68

Your device sends from port 68 to server on port 67.
