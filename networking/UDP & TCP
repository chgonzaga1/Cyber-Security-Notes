IP helps devices talk to each other by identifying the destination using an IP address. 
But to actually send data between applications on different devices, we need transport protocols. 
The two used for this are UDP and TCP.

UDP is a simple, fast, connectionless protocol.
It doesn’t set up a connection and doesn’t check if the data arrived.
It just sends the packet and moves on.
Because of this, UDP is great for things where speed is more important than perfection—like voice calls
or video streaming. But the downside is there’s no confirmation that the receiver actually got the data.

Ports identify which application is sending or receiving the data. UDP uses port numbers from **1 to 65535.**

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

TCP is connection-oriented and focuses on reliable delivery.
It makes sure data arrives correctly and in the right order.
To start communication, TCP uses a three-way handshake:

SYN – Client wants to connect and sends a SYN.
SYN-ACK – Server replies with SYN-ACK.
ACK – Client responds with ACK. Connection is now open.
TCP uses sequence numbers and acknowledgements so the receiver knows exactly what data arrived and 
what might need to be resent.

TCP also uses ports 1–65535, with port 0 reserved, same as UDP 

In summary, TCP is all aobut accuracy and UDP is more of speed delivery
